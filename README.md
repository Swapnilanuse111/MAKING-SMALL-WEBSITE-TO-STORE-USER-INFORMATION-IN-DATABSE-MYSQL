Overview: What You’re Building

You’re building a Java Web Application (using JSP + Servlet + JDBC + MySQL) that:

Shows a registration form (HTML/JSP page)

Takes user input (like name, email, password)

Sends that data to a Servlet

The Servlet uses JDBC to insert it into a MySQL database

Returns a success/failure message to the browser
